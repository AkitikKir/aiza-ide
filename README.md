# Aiza IDE

Aiza IDE is a cross-platform development env for Vibe Coding, built with Kotlin and Jetpack Compose Multiplatform. It features an integrated AI coding agent powered by the Aiza API.

## Features

- **Cross-Platform**: Runs on Windows, macOS, and Linux.
- **AI Coding Agent**: Integrated chat assistant that can:
  - Create and edit files.
  - Run shell commands.
  - Assist with coding tasks through a chat interface.
- **Modern UI**: Multi-pane layout with File Explorer, Code Editor, and Chat Panel.
- **Secure**: Sensitive data like API keys are managed via `.env` files and GitHub Secrets.

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- JDK 17 or higher.
- Aiza API Key (Get it from [aiza-ai.ru](https://api.aiza-ai.ru)).

### Local Setup

1.  **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-repo/aiza-ide.git
    cd aiza-ide
    ```

2.  **Configure Environment**:
    Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and add your `AIZA_API_KEY`.
    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```

3.  **Run the application**:
    ```bash
    ./gradlew :desktopApp:run
    ```

### Building Distributions

To package the application for your current OS:
```bash
./gradlew :desktopApp:package
```

## AI Agent Commands

The agent recognizes structured JSON commands within its responses. For example:

- **Create a file**:
  ```json
  {
    "command": "file.create",
    "path": "src/HelloWorld.kt",
    "content": "fun main() { println(\"Hello, Aiza!\") }"
  }
  ```

- **Run a shell command**:
  ```json
  {
    "command": "shell.run",
    "cmd": "./gradlew build"
  }
  ```

## Security & Privacy

- **Never commit `.env` files**. The `.gitignore` file is pre-configured to exclude it.
- **GitHub Secrets**: For CI/CD, add your `AIZA_API_KEY` to your repository's secrets.
- **Sanitized Examples**: See `examples/api_queries.md` for safe API usage examples.

## CI/CD

The project includes a GitHub Actions workflow that automatically builds and packages the IDE for Ubuntu, Windows, and macOS on every push to the `main` branch.
